- Added new block types for deep ResNets and UNets: :class:`~radionets.architecture.BottleneckResBlock`,
  :class:`~radionets.architecture.Encoder`, and :class:`~radionets.architecture.Decoder`
- Introduced new submodules :mod:`~radionets.architecture.activation`,
  :mod:`~radionets.architecture.archs`, and :mod:`~radionets.architecture.blocks`

  - Related classes (e.g., blocks, activation functions) and functions are moved
    from other submodules into these respective submodules
  - Improves readability and reusability

- Added a logger that replaces bare prints throughout the code base
- Added new diverging colormap `radionets.PuOr` that is used for plotting in radionets
